#This password cracker will bruteforce the password for several locked files.
#We will need to try all of the possible permutations of passwords until we

#SETUP

viewAll = True #True or False, select False for maximum speed.

#There are three files we want to break.
#LockedFile1 - we know the password is only 4 characters and only lowercase letters
#LockedFile2 - 4 characters long but mix of upper and lowercase letters
#LockedFile3 - Between 4-6 characters long, mix of upper, lowercase and symbols.
